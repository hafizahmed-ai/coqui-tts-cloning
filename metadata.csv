"data-06|priyanka|girls that take charge of their own lives and they say, you know, I'm not going to fit into the cookie cutter mold that probably my mother did or my grandmother had."
"data-05|priyanka|feeling rejuvenated, feeling excited and really motivated to take my career forward. I mean this generation of girls is fearless and there's so many"
"data-02|priyanka|one time, you know, five shifts, don't sleep, don't eat and the more a person does that, the more successful you will be. But as"
"data-01|priyanka|when I was younger. It was really romanticized that you're going for it and just keep going and you know it's like you have to work 24 hours, do four movies in"
data-04|priyanka|recently my phones were off me and my husband just by ourselves we spent time we walked on the beach we collected shells and then I came back
"data-08|priyanka|choices that they've made. Thank you so much, Ranveer. Thank you for having me back. Please do have been waiting for this anticipation has you that means so much to"
"data-11|priyanka|be helpful rather than a thorn on your side. So I'm glad. Yeah, actually, happier than I've been in a really long time. I think I reached a place where"
"data-09|priyanka|I also started at something different and it's just so nice when someone understands what your goal is and instead of standing in your way,"
"data-21|priyanka|has to be rough and it's not. Work can be your companion, work can be creative, work can be something that gives you joy and now I've reached a point"
data-13|priyanka|35 I guess and maybe it is just having my feet on the ground and a little bit more stable ground.
"data-14|priyanka|I think I'm not running as fast as I was. I'm thinking about the steps I take. I'm in a really comfortable, content place when it comes to my life."
data-20|priyanka|feeling excited and really motivated to take my career forward. So this romanticization of work has to be tough and work has to be...
data-10|priyanka|helps you pushes you just a little bit and I kind of maybe sense that feeling from you and I always like to stand and
data-16|priyanka|bit more happy and calm. You understand it a little bit. It was really romanticized that you're going for it and just keep going and you know it's like you have to work 24
"data-19|priyanka|My phones were off, me and my husband just by ourselves. We spent time, we walked on the beach, we collected shells, and then I came back feeling rejuvenated."
"data-18|priyanka|be. But as I have seen and lived more life, I've realized having a work-life balance is really important. So when you talk about a beach, I was in Turks and Caicos just recently."
data-15|priyanka|the choices that I'm making are mine and are not defined by other people or the validation that I probably needed when I was younger. So I think that's made me a little
"data-12|priyanka|where I stopped struggling with the things that it when I was younger. Maybe it's maturity, maybe it's being on the other side of the"
"data-17|priyanka|hours, do four movies in one time, you know, five shifts, don't sleep, don't eat. And the more a person does that, the more successful you will be."
"data-33|priyanka|I won my first badge in which was Miss India. I was like, wow, I've won the world. I'm really successful. Then I won Miss World. I was like, yeah, guess what?"
data-29|priyanka|Oh my gosh. I don't even know what I was. What was? Holy wow. That's one year into me being an actor. Bombay when I was 11 years old with my brother.
data-36|priyanka|How do you sign a movie? My poor father was a physician. He didn't know even more and he was like highly protective. They gave up their practice and for two working daughters.
"data-34|priyanka|I had no computation of 18, 17, had no understanding how it happened. But what I did understand was that"
data-28|priyanka|legacy for my children and for the future generation that may not have even seen the potential of something like that for themselves. Why would I give it up?
"data-23|priyanka|I'm acting, whatever. But when I switch off, I'm with my family. I'm at home. I watch movies. I do whatever I want to do. So then when I come back to work,"
"data-35|priyanka|was the opportunity it gave. Suddenly people knew me, wanted to know me, gave me new opportunities. There were movies that were coming my way. I didn't know anything about how"
"data-25|priyanka|I want to have a shack and go out. It used to be my dream when I worked like that too. I want to have a shack and go out, not wear shoes, chappal pahankke, have fish fry all day. You know, and that's what I'm trying to do."
"data-32|priyanka|to do the best you can. Survive, keep your head above water and slowly you'll see you'll be walking on it. Ummm... it's a really tough question because when I"
data-26|priyanka|I wanted to do. But as I realized that there's something I love my job and I love being able to create in very different ways. I have the
"data-31|priyanka|the queen's necklace. All of that was all I knew about Mumbai. Industry was terrifying to me and I think, or just give yourself a break. It's okay. You just have"
data-30|priyanka|was like wow Bombay you know that park where they have the shoe and I had photographs in the hanging gardens even now and that was like going to the beach was seeing
"data-24|priyanka|the next day, I have the focus to be able to do even more things. So when you're talking about retiring at like 35, 40, sure, if you want to have"
data-27|priyanka|privilege to be in a position that not many have been in and I've created that by myself. I don't want to give it up and I don't want anyone to take it away from me. It's my
"data-22|priyanka|with that work-life balance for me is most important. I will work on the six verticals that I'm working on, you know, my business, my production, my book."
"data-41|priyanka|wake up every day with wanting to give back, whether that's with the person that is standing right next to me or whether that is a life choice that I might make."
data-37|priyanka|doctors who were very successful in Bireli and this is something I didn't even think about till I was like 30 years old gave up everything to pursue my 19 year old dream.
data-38|priyanka|my 19 year old opportunities that even and I always think about it like if you think why do I have why am I lucky enough to have the life that I
"data-46|priyanka|women changed the trajectory of the next generation of women. My co-actors, female co-actors, that fought to be the face on the podium."
"data-42|priyanka|But giving back, I think, is so crucial when it comes to being grateful. I'm highly grateful for everything that I have. And I do think that maybe I did something"
"data-44|priyanka|having agency in my own life, if you think about women around the world, so many don't have that. The complete choices are made for themselves. But my parents..."
data-49|priyanka|right? And that's a huge responsibility on all of us. You're on the spot. Films are films. We still talk about female lead films as female lead films. We don't say that's a male lead.
"data-39|priyanka|do and some other woman somewhere else with the same opportunity, with the same desires, same ambitions, same, you know, needs."
"data-43|priyanka|right, that I've been blessed with the opportunity of having the life, being born to the parents that I was, being able to have the opportunity of making my own choices."
data-40|priyanka|doesn't have any of it. I really think about that a lot. It makes me feel like there must be something I did right. I wake up every day with a sense of gratitude and I wake up
data-45|priyanka|told me you have to have your opinion. What a privilege. An actor who was talking to me and I really did say that my generation of
"data-47|priyanka|poster that fought for agency in the movies that a lot of women didn't get before us, just opened the doors for the generation after us. And I think not"
"data-48|priyanka|for women but people, our generation and every generation will always have a prototype that will be better than us. We have changed the landscape."
"data-50|priyanka|This person's film, Amir Khan's movie, oh, we're watching a male lead film today. But that's as a vocabulary we need to change. Female athlete, female politician."
data-55|priyanka|that people that tell us that you know I was talking the other day about someone that when I went to Convince school I had this thing called moral science a subject called moral science
data-64|priyanka|feel about this person. It's about that feeling. It's about imbibing from the people around you and it could be someone you admire.
"data-63|priyanka|work with. The reason I take new steps is because I see someone else doing something new and I'm like, I do, that'll make me feel how I feel."
"data-57|priyanka|There's so much that has been told to women that to be a good girl, you have to be a certain way. Good girls don't make history, you know what I mean?"
"data-53|priyanka|or my grandmother had to. And it's so like I have goosebumps right now just thinking about it. I mean, so many young women who have changed the trajectory of their family."
"data-51|priyanka|female actress, why? Actress, politician, act can be very scary. You know, we, I mean, this generation of girls is fearless."
"data-58|priyanka|bold girls make history, bold people make history. So if you want to be the lead actor of your movie, which is your life,"
"data-52|priyanka|and there's so many girls that take charge of their own lives and they say, you know, I'm not going to fit into the cookie cutter mold that probably my mother did."
"data-56|priyanka|which taught me how women shouldn't be seen, not heard, the lengths of our skirts, how we should sit with our legs."
data-59|priyanka|You've got to take choices that might be contrary to what you've heard. And that empowerment may or may not come from your parents. May on may not come from
"data-65|priyanka|on television, it could be someone in your class, it could be someone that you work with. But when you see something that you admire about someone,"
"data-62|priyanka|gut because no one's going to fix your life but you. From people that inspire you, I have been inspired every day by collaborators that I've"
"data-54|priyanka|because of the choices that they've made. I think my message would be that there's a lot of noise around us, yeah, and people that tell us to be a certain way."
"data-60|priyanka|from your family or boyfriend or whoever you're around, it comes from you. And that no one can do, you know? I, again, was lucky maybe because my parents gave me that."
"data-61|priyanka|But I try to remind young girls specifically that if you don't have that, if you don't have that encouragement in your home, try to find it in your"
"data-67|priyanka|how far I can go. I mean, who knows what my future holds for me. But what I can think about is my present. And like I said, I like to imagine"
"data-79|priyanka|be a venture capitalist and she was really into tech and stuff. So I was very interested in and at that time she was just a collaborator, but I really got interested in"
"data-72|priyanka|about making your own movies, you know, starting production and that at that time is really funny considering I'm 40 and I'm still have a very active acting career, but it was"
"data-74|priyanka|I started getting interested in production, just thinking about the fact that I was going to lose my day job. And then that became really interesting to me."
"data-78|priyanka|to create something. And I think once I started doing production and I started working in America, I knew my manager happened to have an"
"data-80|priyanka|investments. And I started with small investments in little things. And then those things became really big, like bumbles."
"data-71|priyanka|50 year old actors only want to work with the girls in their 20s. So after 30 you're not going to have a job very much, you know, just like if you start planning for your future. So"
"data-69|priyanka|to sit and watch why they did what they did. So this came from a really funny thought. My mom, as soon as I turned 30, she's an entrepreneur. She's a doctor."
"data-76|priyanka|working with, what are the choices they make, how are movies made. So you have a cost of production, you have to recover your cost of production to make profit. So I started getting into"
data-77|priyanka|what margins looked like and just understanding that and that was fascinating to me because it's so creative. There are so many ways to be able
"data-75|priyanka|The business of entertainment started becoming really interesting to me. I used to talk a lot to my producer friends, producers that I was"
data-73|priyanka|foresight on her end in an industry which kind of told women that that you know when you're 30 sorry you're too old. So
"data-70|priyanka|She created her own business. But when I soon as I turned 30, she tapped me down and she said, look, you're in Bollywood. Your shelf life is over. You know, nobody, all these"
"data-68|priyanka|I'm imbibed from people that I know. Like I told you, I like to imbibed from the people around me. When I was becoming an actor, I didn't know anything about acting. So I used to sit and watch my co-actors."
"data-66|priyanka|in Bibid. I don't know, I don't think about the future. I'm not someone who I plan for the future but I don't think about"
"data-93|priyanka|things that come from the West. That I agree is a fact. But no, it's not the easiest thing to be an Indian in America. It's not easy."
"data-89|priyanka|bringing them, but I really lean on my partners to learn from them. And I just love the fact that you can have an idea today and monetize it. Why not? You're not"
data-95|priyanka|the industry. I started with music and then pivoted into acting in America. So I started in 2010 for Context. In 2020 I got my
"data-90|priyanka|You're not just reduced to, I won't say reduced to because I come from a family of doctors and engineers, but at that time in my parents' generation and the"
"data-96|priyanka|first leading role. How long did it take me? 10 years. So people don't think about how much hard work, how much consistent knocking on doors."
"data-85|priyanka|and live in sometimes in India. How beautiful is that? Like again, I have goosebumps just thinking about the fact that this came from an idea."
"data-87|priyanka|the entrepreneur journey in me. First, I started with investments and Anomaly is my first brand that I founded myself with the help of Mesa."
"data-88|priyanka|with the help of me. So that were market leaders and leaders in incubating new brands specifically in beauty. And then Nica, of course,"
data-86|priyanka|So ideas are what was really interesting to me and then being able to work with people who can help me execute ideas is what really started
"data-82|priyanka|a new idea. And the idea at that time was when Bumble was launched around the world and Whitney, who's a dear friend of mine, and launched it, she left Tinder to make Bumble because"
"data-97|priyanka|how much humility it takes to go to another country and start from scratch. I had built an incredible career here, an amazing credibility here."
"data-83|priyanka|saw the gap in the market that, you know, we want to be able to create a safe space where women have the first opportunity, where women can take the first step. And that was such a"
"data-81|priyanka|I brought Bumble into India. I mean, Bumble changed the dating scene in India, especially for girls. And that just showed me the power of being able to have"
data-94|priyanka|I started working in the States in 2010 and in 2020 after 10 years of working in the
"data-91|priyanka|before that, it was doctor, engineer, lawyer, militia, government job. Like those five or six things that everyone had to aim for. But today, like I think my job is to"
"data-92|priyanka|generation of parents are not going to have those boxes for our children, right? You have an idea. Let's run with it. We have a lot of equity on, on"
data-84|priyanka|a brilliant plan. And what I said was India needs it the most because of especially the unsafe circumstances within which girls have to
"data-108|priyanka|movies in Hollywood. But that's what it took for me when I started here. A lot of people used to say to me, oh, she's left doing Bollywood movies to do small"
"data-107|priyanka|I would love to work. I would love to see if there's an opportunity. I remember I had to do, I mean, I've done so many small roles in big movies."
"data-109|priyanka|roles in Hollywood. It started with every new actor starts, you have to start with from the beginning and I don't sit with that, you know, if you're"
data-98|priyanka|And I got an opportunity to do music and people were curious about the fact that because I could sing what that could be and I'm a big fan of the
"data-101|priyanka|very excited about that opportunity when they're worked with the most incredible musicians and quickly realized that I'm not as good as them, you know, and I should"
data-99|priyanka|the music industry anyway. We in India are monopolized by Bollywood when it comes to music so much. I hope so. I hope so that we've not really been able
data-104|priyanka|my lane. And that made me want to dabble in acting as well and see if there was an opportunity there. But it required me to strip
"data-105|priyanka|every single thing that I knew in India and the laurels that I had achieved in India, the awards that I had won, the movies that I had done, the box"
data-102|priyanka|go back to my day job. I don't like I'm very astute when it comes to I don't lie to myself. I'm very honest to myself. So I did the music. I love the
data-113|priyanka|audition and you have to work around the culture of a new country and that was so hard. I had to swallow the humility pill and I was willing to do that hard work and then
"data-111|priyanka|a certain way or if you're making a certain amount of money in a certain country, you're going to be treated the same way because everyone is waiting in Hollywood."
data-112|priyanka|Hollywood is not the same without you. It doesn't work that you have to go. You have to pound the pavement. You have to walk in. You have to be rejected. You have to watch
data-100|priyanka|able to bifurcate into pop music or pop culture when it comes to music. It's still very niche. So I was really a big fan of like music and musicians and other
"data-110|priyanka|if I'm successful in one country, then everyone in the world should treat me. It doesn't work. And I don't know about that, but most people expect and anticipate that if you are treating"
"data-106|priyanka|of his successes that I had seen, it required me to walk into rooms with extreme humility and introduce myself, take my show reel and say, this is the"
"data-103|priyanka|music that I did for myself but it wasn't my standard of excellence. It was good. It was fun. They had on the radio, it was successful, sold a lot of CDs but it wasn't my standard."
"data-115|priyanka|I have never got the same check as my male co-actor, even if my part is the same, even if I've held the movie as much as I"
"data-129|priyanka|Why is my natural instinct not saying, wow, you've done so great. Let me add on to this person."
data-130|priyanka|person. Let me push you forward because then you're pulling me forward. There is such a strength in numbers which we don't recognize if we only collect
"data-123|priyanka|So when you say, you know, I don't want to pass off the work that it took to get there and the time and the commitment that it took to get"
"data-128|priyanka|to recognize that. Our generation has to say, hold on, hold on. Why is my natural instinct when someone is successful is to be jealous? Why is my natural instinct"
"data-117|priyanka|great for you and how it was awesome. But the tears that it took when you moved to a new country with no friends, no family, working with people"
"data-122|priyanka|So no, it wasn't easy. It was very hard. It took a lot of sweat, tears, and blood from me to finally be able to reach where I have reached."
"data-125|priyanka|If you ask me the question, in India we've been taught that mindset. We are not people as a people. Very few of us are happy for somebody else's."
data-120|priyanka|just couldn't understand why and it required me to just you know be humble and say I'm okay this is a new and
"data-124|priyanka|Still at the beginning, that's what I'm saying. It's the first movie that I'm doing with Bhad. Who knows where else I'll go. Someone who talks about my struggles too much."
"data-126|priyanka|success. Because we, again, I think my hypothesis, and I don't know, I'm not someone who's an expert on the field, but my hypothesis is that"
"data-121|priyanka|It's easy to go fishing from your boat, but when you have to go deep sea diving, it's a completely different thing. So you have to learn according to your environment."
"data-118|priyanka|that don't know you and don't know what you are able to achieve. When I first started doing Quantico, my co-actors did not understand the hoopla around me. They were like,"
"data-119|priyanka|Why is who is this person? Like, why are you, you know, the leader of that was the first time I got a lead role in a television series."
"data-127|priyanka|that we were colonised, we've just about, not even been 100 years, we've just about been our own country, our own people. And our generation has"
"data-116|priyanka|I can finally I got it in 2021 after 21 years of working. So it seems like, oh my gosh, America was so"
"data-114|priyanka|10 years later, I finally got my leading role in a movie. I finally got the same renumeration as a man, which I never did in Bollywood."
"data-142|priyanka|Thank you for my family. Thank you for my lifestyle. Thank you for my ability to be a nice human being, to be a great human being."
"data-147|priyanka|have unachievable dreams, something that seems too out of the ordinary, then you're waiting for a miracle. And miracles don't happen very often. You have to create"
"data-139|priyanka|individual. Do you have that inside of you to fight that fight for yourself or are you going to wait for somebody else to do it? That's an individual choice. I mean,"
"data-144|priyanka|secret and the vision board and all of that. But it's not something that ever worked. Put shit up. Okay, this is what I want to achieve, but I didn't focus enough on it for it to work for me. What has"
"data-143|priyanka|grateful person. And then, I don't know, I mean, I don't know, I don't think that I believe, listen, a lot of people believe in"
"data-136|priyanka|negative and you'll never move forward. You have to shut off the noise. There are many people that will want to pull you down, but don't focus on that. Focus on the one person."
"data-138|priyanka|hardest thing to do because you're bogged down by baggage, you're bogged down by shackles of people holding you down. So you have to really push forward and that's just"
"data-145|priyanka|always work is having the small next dream, you know, the next step. So that you always have to take a step up in the ladder to be able to get"
"data-146|priyanka|to the top. You can't get to the top by flying up human beings own fly. Yes. And then slowly you'll turn around and you say, Oh, whoa, look at this legacy. I've got a few"
"data-131|priyanka|banded together and supported other successful people in our fields, we would be unstoppable in the world. We are one fifth of the world's population."
"data-132|priyanka|But we've never been able to take our own stand because of that reason. I don't know about where that learning comes from, but I just, I just like"
"data-141|priyanka|How do you pray and what do you pray for? I do puja almost every day. I do thank you. Starts with thank you. It starts with thank you for my health, thank you for my life."
data-135|priyanka|in the shit. You can sit in the shit and then you'll start smelling of it and then you don't even know you're smelling of it because you've got so used to it. So then you just become dark and negative.
"data-140|priyanka|A lot of it is. I really do believe in destiny. I believe in, I'm someone who has a lot of faith. I pray a lot."
"data-133|priyanka|you. I've also had people wanting to jeopardize my career. I don't know, take away from work, make sure that I wasn't cast just because you know, I was doing well in what I"
data-134|priyanka|I was doing but that's not what stopped. I don't sit and wait and harp on. I mean maybe I'll cry one night or the other when an opportunity was taken away from me but I don't sit
"data-137|priyanka|person that believes in you. Focus on the light, little sliver of light that you might see, a little bit of inspiration that you might see and that's the heart"
data-149|priyanka|is one thing I'll work backwards and what is the first step in that goal I'll take that then the next step in that goal and slowly you'll buy your car yeah I'd like to tell
"data-156|priyanka|Like, that was her idea. And she built it into an empire today. So age ain't nothing but a number. That's a real, real fact."
"data-153|priyanka|going to happen? What is the stress around it? You're gonna get older. I mean, yeah, I feel like I did when I was still 18, but like I'm going to get older."
data-155|priyanka|60. Who is it that you want to be? I was just doing an interview with a Falgurina and she started and started Nica at 50.
"data-160|priyanka|and whether if that's two people, not easy to be a public person. Like, you know, we talk a lot about the public."
data-161|priyanka|about and we point a lot of fingers at celebrities and public people. It's a really hard job. It is so hard
"data-151|priyanka|ceiling for you right there. I mean, you're telling yourself you're too old. Everyone's aging. That's the one thing as a fact we know, birth and death. That's going to happen to all of us."
data-157|priyanka|too much equity on age. It just doesn't matter. What matters is what you do about your life in the moment right now. Are you champions?
"data-148|priyanka|for yourself. So what's the next step in your big dream? So if you want to buy a car, say for example, you have to figure out how much it's for, you have to work backwards from your goal. So if my goal"
data-163|priyanka|I am for public consumption.
data-164|priyanka|It can be an opinion that is completely the opposite of who I am. People could think I'm unlikable. People could say that I'm a horrible person.
"data-158|priyanka|And maybe this is also something I realize when I'm older, but I tell young people this all the time, don't not hang around with poisonous people. Do not keep people around you"
"data-150|priyanka|my younger self not to have stressed out so much. I used to have a lot of anxiety around losing my job, losing my... Yeah, well, that's your glass."
"data-159|priyanka|are toxic that mess with your brain, keep people around you that are genuinely happy with happy for you. Only people that are genuinely"
data-152|priyanka|you have to age. Like that's something that really comes to terms with early on in your life. Why are we putting so much equity on aging? The one thing we know that is
data-162|priyanka|It is so hard to be in a table conversation every single day. It is so hard to walk into a room and know that somebody is going to be talking about me when I leave.
"data-154|priyanka|And who am I right now at this age is what's important. What is my best opportunity at 18, at 25, at 35, at"
"data-172|priyanka|You know, public people even though you're seeing a celebrity or someone every day on like billboards or"
"data-166|priyanka|social media or keep wondering about the paranoia of when I walk out of the room, what is someone saying, oh my God, I'll never be able to achieve anything. But it's"
data-170|priyanka|And fame is not my job. It's very clear to me. I'm not famous for a living. I work for a living.
data-178|priyanka|laurels. That's your downfall right there. I think the meaning of life is having purpose.
"data-168|priyanka|to be in that position, but nobody sees how hard it is. Like it is so hard when you are going to a Shadi, suppose your family's Shadi and every"
"data-175|priyanka|and I come from the ground and I'm gonna stay there. And the day I'd behaved a certain way, my mom would put a tupley on my head and say, come back."
